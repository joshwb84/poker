Poker homework
Second commit

simulate the dealing of a 5-card hand of poker (i.e. five random playing cards) – use https://github.com/kiei925-winter15/poker for a good starting point.

Display the cards as images – these are available publicly, following this naming convention – http://golearntocode.com/images/cards/number_of_suit.png. For example, http://golearntocode.com/images/cards/10_of_diamonds.png is the image for the 10 of diamonds.
